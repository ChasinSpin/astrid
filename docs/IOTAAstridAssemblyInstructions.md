## Additional Items Required For Assembly

* Flex Superglue Liquid (Flex Seal) _Do not use the gel_. This bonds to plastic/resin.  Many hardware stores, e.g. HomeDepot, can also be bought online.
* [Loctite 242](https://www.amazon.com/Henkel-Loctite-Threadlocker-Medium-Strength/dp/B01GWFHAM2/ref=sr_1_2?crid=47965PK44JFB&keywords=loctite+242&qid=1704863154&sprefix=loctite+242%2Caps%2C229&sr=8-2)

## Tools Required For Assembly

* Small pliers
* Scissors
* Small tweezers
* Phillips Screw Driver (long shaft, thin, shaft diameter max 4mm)
* Hobby Knife
* Camera Puffer Blower

## Sub-Assembly Instructions

### Case Sub-Assembly

* Superglue posts
* Superglue 4 captive nuts
* Cover captive nuts with Kaptop after glue dry
* Insert fan, and place fan guard on top (fan guard is fragile)

### Camera Sub-Assembly

* Clip 0V pin (leave XVS pin untouched)
* Place adhesive gasket for CS Mount
* Place Loctite on screws, and screw CS Mount to board
* Use tweezers to remove sensor cover, being careful to avoid damaging sensor
* Hold board upside down and puffer blow off any dust
* Screw in 2 extension rings, IOTA CS to 1.25" converter and IOTA 0.5X Focal Reducer to protect sensor from dust
* Add Yellow Cap to Focal Reducer

_Note: There is one extension ring spare for some setups that might benefit from it if they can handle the increased focal reduction and still focus.  Ordinarily 2 rings are optimal for the 0.5X focal reducer._
