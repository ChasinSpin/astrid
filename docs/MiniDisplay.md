# Astrid Mini Display

## Introduction

The Astrid Mini Display is a small device with a display that displays Astrid's current network settings.

It connects over USB (USB2 or USB3), and its buttons can be used to switch between Hotspot and WiFi router mode.

In the future, it will be used to provide additional functionality.

Only 1 Astrid Mini Display is required for all your Astrids, it doesn't have to be connected for Astrid to start, and can be removed and plugged into another Astrid whilst both are running.

## Requirements

USB-B to USB-C cable with both power **AND DATA** is required.
