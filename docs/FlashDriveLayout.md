# USB Flash Drive Layout

**Note: Astrid ships with a preformatted USB drive, you only require these instructions if are reformatting that drive (in which case back it up first), or if you need a second USB drive.**

## Introduction

The flash drive is used to store astrometry files, images taken, log files, and video.  Because the video is written raw, high throughput is critical, and a regular USB flash drive will not be fast enough.

Never remove the flash drive without shutting down Astrid first.

## Flash Drive Creation

To format the USB Flash Drive, you must use the Astrid Tool designed for the purpose to format, layout the drive and copy needed files:

On the Astrid Desktop in "Astrid Tools", double tap(or double click) "Format USB Flash Drive" and follow instructions.

## Configs

Please add any needed telescope configurations in the configs folder.  Currently, these have to be entered manually in the .json files.
