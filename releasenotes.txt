Version 1.0.044:
================

	* Added new warning message for Auto Record, when video frame rate is slower than 1/2 the maximum event duration

	* Added automatic removal of bad ASTRID drive mount point caused by power removal without shutdown

	* Now logs the power voltage every 5 minutes for 2 purposes, provide an audit trail for faulty/inadequate power and to show Astrid is alive when it's idle

	* Now logs more user interaction for Auto Record and recording in Photo and OTE Video modes

	* Mount settings for indi module and usb tty are now constrained to a choice list.  Mismatch between indi driver name and settings driver name is now detected and prompted to auto fix

Version 1.0.043:
================

	* Fixed bug that was reintroduced by change in 1.0.042, where if the occultation target wasn't goto'd, the RA/DEC of the target were not recorded in the .ravf metadata, preventing the target identification crosshairs in Player.

Version 1.0.042:
================

	* Fixed frame rate and exposure duration to "Switch to OTE Video" prompt when Auto Recording

Version 1.0.041:
================

	* Fixed bug where the "Object Found, Goto?" always results in a Goto, even if No is selected

	* Added frame rate and exposure duration to "Switch to OTE Video" prompt when Auto Recording

	* Prepoint window is now further to the left of the video window

	* When syncing events from OWCloud, the default start/end times are "at least" 30 seconds prior to the start and 30 seconds after the end of the event.

	* On the Auto Record panel (and other panels where date/time editing is disabled), the up/down arrows have been removed for clarity

	* Cleanship script (for Ted) now reactivates the privacy notice

Version 1.0.037:
================

	* Changed behavior where if an occultation is selected, and not "go-to'd" on a goto scope, the RA/DEC of the target are not recorded
	  to the .ravf file.  They are now recorded to the .ravf file.

	* Fixed bug in player where ravf_integrated videos didn't load in player (also requires new ravf version)

Version 1.0.036:
================

	* Fixed bug where a Prepoint (or platesolve when a target is selected), if the telescope is pointing near the North Celestial Pole, caused
	  Astrid to quit as it was unable to paint the target. This is due to the NCP being a singularity, so it's impossible for the Astrometry system
	  to paint a bullseye indicating the position of the target. The target is no longer painted in this situation until the user has moved away
	  from the NCP either via a Goto or Prepoint.

Version 1.0.035:

	* Added auto stretches (Histogram Equalization, CLAHE and MinMax Presets/Custom)
	
	* Fixed a bug where version was displayed as None when not connected to the internet
	
	* Added the software version number to the ravf metadata
